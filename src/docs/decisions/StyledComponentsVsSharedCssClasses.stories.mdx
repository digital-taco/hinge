# Styled Components vs. Shared CSS Classes

The problem:

Multiple components need a colored background that automatically matches the current theme.

Do you create a styled component that handles setting the background?

Or do you create a shared CSS class that can be applied to each of the container elements that need it?

### Styled Components

#### Pros

- Tends to be scoped much more than CSS
- Somewhat clearer declarative code
- Can be multi-purpose
- Can encourage clearer semantics (since it may need to be an article, section, etc.)
- Purpose is more clear to the consumer

#### Cons

- Unless using it as a polymorphic component, it will add another layer to the dom
- Specific to the framework

### Shared CSS Classes

#### Pros

- Easy to implement and use
- Doesn't add to the dom in any way (other than the classname)

#### Cons

- More likely to run into cascade issues
- Less clear as to what its purpose is
- More likely to run into naming conflicts (still very unlikely)
- Much less configurable
- Cannot be multi-purpose

## Decision

Use styled components. While not framework agnostic, it is much clearer what the purpose is. It is better to avoid a mix of styled components and shared css classnames.
