# Interactive Element Styling

Interactive Elements (anything that has to do with the mouse or keyboard) should have the following:

- Color variables for each css state
  - hover, active, focus, and disabled
- Default cursor as `pointer`
- Have a respective cursor when disabled
- Handle `focus-visible` properly

The consumer should be able to set these variables and override them as needed. Any modifying css, such `transition`, should not be locked down. The consumer should be able to set them.
