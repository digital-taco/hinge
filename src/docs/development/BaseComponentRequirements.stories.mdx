# Base Component Requirements

All base components will:

- Be ref forwarded
- Be polymorphic (the `as` prop (REQUIRED))
- Accept the `className` prop
- Accept the `style` prop
- Accept all standard dom attributes
- Remove native css styling to prevent common styling bloat
- Be properly typed so Typescript can properly diagnose issues, even with the `as` prop
